# Quantum_Integer_Programming
Quantum algorithms for Integer Programming.
This folder contains the material I've been working on during my internship and Master's thesis.
Specifically, I'm exploring Quantum approaches to combinatorial optimization, with a special focus on Vehicle Routing Problems.
In this folder you'll find the theoretical material as well as the code I'm working on.
